# Challenge-3-Javascript

## This application shows my ability to use Javascript to create a random password generator.

Allows the user to select the parameters of the password generator (ie. character length, including special characters, numbers, lower, and uppercase letters).

This was done using a series of if-statements followed by a windows.prompt and window.comfirm(s) to assign individual characterarrays into a single confirmed parameter array. If for some reason there aren'y any prompts selected throughout the if-statement, then an alert will let them know that they need to select at least one prompt and then will end the sequence.

Then a for-loop is used to randomly select a value from the confirmed parameter array and add it to a password string. This process is repeated for the same value of the password length determined in the if-statements.
